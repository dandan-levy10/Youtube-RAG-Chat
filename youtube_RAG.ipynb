      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'C4P3XSySBC8'}, page_content='[Music] Douglas Murray, welcome to Honestly. Great pleasure to be with you. So, Douglas, we\\'re sitting here and we are right on the cusp of the big 100 day mark of the second Trump presidency. And I\\'d be remiss if I didn\\'t ask you to help us make sense of it. How\\'s he doing? What grade would you give him? Um, well, I\\'m slightly allergic to 100 days style things. Is it a very American thing? Well, no, it\\'s like anniversaries, you know, when we\\'re doing this because it\\'s the 243rd anniversary. Um, but no, it is a it is of course a milestone of a kind. Um, well, they\\'ve certainly been treating it as one, meaning they want to get as much done in the 100 days. And there\\'s been, I think, more executive orders than almost any president perhaps since FDR. Yes. uh which is an interesting way of doing things and is something that you could see coming. Trump had said this was going to h how he\\'s going to do things. I think for me the interesting thing is always a comparison with Trump one. Um you know Trump won it was uh frankly a mess. Uh people were in positions who the president didn\\'t seem to you know know or rate and then he had to give them the heaveho and replace him with other people. And this time round he\\'s had four years to prepare for this. Obviously he was preparing for it very seriously. He knew he want who he wanted to surround himself with. He knew he wanted loyalists crucially uh Trump loyalists and that\\'s what he\\'s done. I just said that uh the fact that there has been so little um pandemonium is just worth noting. Uh some people might think there has been, but really I mean it\\'s nothing nothing like it was. Uh it\\'s been pretty orderly. Uh it\\'s been concerted. There have been things that the president has done which seem to have amazed people like tariffs most obviously which I cannot understand why people were amazed by because all he did was talk about how he was going to Yes. I mean every time I covered a rally uh you know it\\'s like tariffs were one of the big things he talked about. I don\\'t know whether much of the commentaria class has simply got used to politicians saying they do something and then not doing it and they\\'re kind of shocked that he\\'s actually doing the things he said he\\'d do. But but he is um I mean there\\'s only been one major misstep which was the the signal leap leak and that wasn\\'t compared to some things that have happened in recent years that you know that that story is now blown over. Um to my mind domestically he\\'s done several of the biggest things he said he\\'d do. He has uh stopped almost entirely the illegal movement at the southern border which is one of the things he was voted in on doing. He has been uh deporting illegal foreign criminals. That\\'s one of the things he said he\\'d do. Um tariffs of course. Then on the broader foreign affairs beat, which is what I\\'m sort of in some ways most interested in at the moment, it\\'s a mixed bag. Um, his appointment of Steve Wickoff as the envoy to end all wars is um it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s an audacious appointment to give any man, I think. Uh, I mean, I don\\'t think there\\'s a man or a woman on the on the in the universe who could deal with this number of briefs that Wickoff is having to deal with. But what I find interesting and sometimes concerning is the extent to which uh already Trump\\'s promises on some of the foreign affairs stuff have clearly not been able to be implemented in the way that he promised that they would. Some people will say, well, I mean, it was obviously just campaign rhetoric to say, you know, I\\'m going to stop ex war on day one, like the Russia Ukraine war. Nevertheless, he did say it. And uh, you know, 100 days in, the war is still grinding on there. Uh, there are still hostages in Gaza. Uh, including an Americanborn hostage. Uh, the war is still going on there. the nuclear talks with Iran uh look like seeping into JCPOA.2 um Obama\\'s nuclear deal. The Obama nuclear deal. Um and so on that it\\'s it\\'s on the domestic stuff. I\\'d say a high score. On the foreign affairs stuff, it\\'s a little early to tell, but it\\'s concerning. Give us a little bit more of a sense. Let\\'s just stay on the foreign affairs subject for a second. We have run a lot of pieces in the free press explaining the sort of and I\\'ll be crude about it. The two broad camps uh that are inside the Trump administration on that issue. Um in on certain issues, certain domestic issues, I think the administration speaks with a pretty united voice. But when it comes to foreign policy and the question of muscular foreign policy or pulling back from the world, there\\'s let\\'s say a cacophinous debate. And I would say on one side there\\'s Mike Waltz, former Green Beret. Um he\\'s the one who is I would say of anyone in the administration speaking up most strongly for a kind of stronger hand. Um and then you have others in the administration and this was one of the things you saw in that signal uh leak that was fascinating. You have JD Vance and others sort of caucusing with the they\\'ve rebranded themselves as restrainers. who\\'s winning in that fight between the restrainers and I guess let\\'s say the hawks. Uh it\\'s a little early to say. Um and it seems to go back and forth. We should concede of course that this is a this is not only a a live debate, but of course it\\'s a it\\'s a very serious one. is one of the most serious divides going on within the Trump administration which is I would say not just between the the hawks and the sort of isolationists but it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s one way to think of it. I mean it\\'s also between those people in the administration most obviously JD Vance who really do think that America should withdraw from most of the world and focus its efforts on the only real economic competitor to this country which is China. Um, and then there are others who say, you know, well, they address that fundamental, what I\\'ve said before is a fundamental problem at the heart of the MAGA uh isolationist wing, which is they simultaneously want America to be the world\\'s dominant power, but they don\\'t want to be involved in the world. This is a very serious uh um problem that they at some point they will either address or fail to address. um you know in that signal chat we saw we saw the vice president saying you know he didn\\'t see why America had to keep open the world\\'s water lanes for you know the Europeans or whatever and uh there\\'s a perfectly good argument to say and I\\'ve made it for many years now that the Europeans should step up on defense spending but at the same time uh uh you know if if America and her allies uh don\\'t keep open the world\\'s waterways you know uh the Chinese Communist Party would love to have the job and our friends in Taiwan would be one of the first to suffer from the the order that that would have seen us been ushered in. Um I I I think one one other thing so it was worth touching on on that which is I think that there has I think there is alarm from some people particularly American allies uh I picked this up uh recently on visits abroad. I think there is some alarm about the uh the simultaneous um soft softly softly should we say in regard to Putin in particular um um tolerance of the of the Kremlin actually um not following what the American president has said they should do like you know saying you know they won\\'t attack energy facilities and then promptly attacking them. I think there\\'s concern among America\\'s allies and again I mean the isolationist types can either think this is important or not and maybe they don\\'t think it\\'s important but that at the same time as beating up on actual the softness on the Kremlin and the Ayatollas and Qatar um at the same time as what some of us see as a needless antagonizing of old allies like obviously most clearly Canada and then Denmark. And um I think the Danes are slightly beused by the fact that um what seemed at first almost to be a sort of troll uh has become apparent policy and in the case of Canada and they\\'re going to the voting booths right now. Yeah. an election that seemed like it was a sure bet for Palev, the conservative, now swinging wildly in Mark Carney\\'s direction and he\\'s probably going to run away with the results. Yes. And I mean, seeing Trump say, you know, I don\\'t I don\\'t care um uh who you know, I don\\'t care if Carney wins, the lefties are sort of easier to deal with or um that that has caused some ruptures and ruptions elsewhere. Um so on some of that but and then then on that one of the interesting questions is simply you know who is in charge of of that policy because um much of what is happening in Russia, Ukraine and indeed the Middle East ought to be the brief of um Marco Rubio and he\\'s conspicuously not leading these things. If I was Marco Rubio, I\\'d be absolutely furious that uh uh that Steve Whit Yeah. has more authority than he see he seems to have. Yes. And the real problem on th that those things, by the way, and you don\\'t have to be some kind of hawk to think this, is that the real problem on those things is that um Trump clearly, you know, his decision to appoint his his uh son-in-law Jared Kushner to a let\\'s say similar role in the post 2016 period absolutely paid off. I mean, it really worked. And all the people who said, \"Oh my gosh, I can\\'t believe he\\'s just got this son-in-law. This is what does he know? Um the ultimate nepo baby position, right? He actually pulled off the Abraham Accords. He pulled off the Abraham Accords. It\\'s it was amazing and all credit to him and his father-in-law for that. But um this this decision to bring, as it were, another New York real estate guy in as a result cuz it did work last time. But this time, it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s a little early. I said this in the post the other day. It it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s disturbing to see somebody learn on the job when the job is this serious. Um and when Wickoff said recently that he had found that Hamas were not uh not entirely honest interlocutors in the negotiations, some of us did have a rather overwhelming feeling of it took you how long to work that out. You didn\\'t go in knowing that. um settlement of the Russia Ukraine war. Think about what it is to have a negotiator who whatever his other virtues does not know any of the history of this conflict going into negotiations with Vladimir Putin who has his own entirely different view of history going back of course a couple of millennia. Um that\\'s a problem. It\\'s a problem doing nuclear negotiations if you\\'re just starting off from here dealing with tan because they are they will be very very pleased to be dealing with somebody who does not have their memory. Let me ask one question on Iran and then I want to talk about Joe Rogan and then of course your book on Iran. Um, of course, Trump in his first administration scuttled the JCPOA, uh, Iran\\'s, sorry, Obama\\'s nuclear deal. Um, he called it a horrible deal. Margaret Rubio said something similar. Now, you know, under the leadership of Steve Whit, um, we ran a piece by Mike Duran the other day talking about how Steve Whit is driving the Trump administration on the road to Obama and how strange that result is. We have a president who loves a good deal, loves deals, hates war, really, really hates war. Um, how are you going to be judging whether or not, first of all, do you think a deal is even possible? Maybe let\\'s start there. And second of all, if a deal is possible, how should those of us watching this with a lot of concern judge whether or not it is indeed a good deal? Um, I\\'m actually not very uh positive about a deal. Um, I think it\\'s highly unlikely that America can get the Ayatollah to restrain themselves from enrichment. It\\'s their goal. It\\'s been their goal for decades. Um, now there is talk once again, as in the Obama years, about whether or not uh uh the Iranians could have um uh nuclear energy for civilian energy purposes. And I mean, this is this is excruciating for some of us because we watched this happen before. Whenever the Iranians go that way, um, you know, then you start to catch them out. Whoopsie. It turned out that our civilian nuclear program, our energy nuclear program, we just we\\'re just looking into seeing whether or not we can put it on the top of a missile, you know, to sort of exaggerate things. But that\\'s that\\'s that\\'s that\\'s how they act, how they behave. There\\'s a you know there was something before just shortly before he died uh the late uh scholar of the Muslim world Bernard Lewis at the age of 100 or so was asked by a friend of mine what one thing do you wish that the west would know about the Islamic world that it doesn\\'t? He gave such a brilliant answer. He said, um, I wish they understood that we in the West think in at longest four-year cycles. I mean, really, we think in America about twoyear electoral cycles or 100 days as I began this conversation. 100 days. And he said, I wish people realize that in the in the Muslim world, a decade is the smallest piece of time that people talk in. So for the Mullers, Wickoff comes goes, Obama comes, Trump goes and so on. But the aim remains the same. I think to my mind that the great challenge for Donald Trump is I believe he has committed as he has said that that that Iran will not the Iranian revolutionary government will not become a nuclear power on his watch. For me the question is but what about after him? It is one thing to say that for the next three and a half years or three three years nine months whatever they will not get a bomb. That\\'s good news. That\\'s a start. But the bigger thing is after Trump there could be another Obama, there could be another Biden, there could be an AOC, there could be anybody. Question for me is uh is he able to make sure they never have the bomb? And that will be one of the things that his legacy will be based on. Not just if it happened on his watch. I think he will not allow that. But will it happen on any any future president\\'s watch because of things that happened during his time in office. Um that\\'s one of the things I\\'m watching out for. So there\\'s lots of ways to judge the first 100 days of this administration. We can look at tariffs. We can look at the economy. We can look at immigration. Trump\\'s war against uh elite universities. uh foreign polic which I\\'m sure you celebrate by the way and on and on and on. But I think there\\'s another more um harder to pin down way to think about the past 100 days and that is culturally how things have shifted and some people have talked about this as the vibe shift. There\\'s lots of ways to describe it. Broadly speaking, I think we both know people who were not Republicans but were so disgusted with the excesses of the illiberal left. Uh we\\'re so disgusted with the shutdown of freeth thinking, the sensoriousness around COVID origins, lockdown, the Hunter Biden laptop. We could go on and on and on and on. Biden\\'s mental acuity that they thought, you know what, even if I\\'m not voting for him, I\\'m happy this guy won or I\\'m going to hold my nose and vote for him because they need a corrective. Here we are 100 days later and one of the fastest shifts that I\\'ve ever seen culturally is the shift from focusing on the excesses of the woke left, which let\\'s be honest, that\\'s how the free press got its start, to now this rising illiberalism coming out of the right, what some people have called the woke right. But I\\'ll just give a simple definition of it which is for the past decade or so we have seen an illiberal left that defaces the statues of Churchill and calls him a racist and all kinds of other things. Now we have a group on the right and they are increasing in prominence that says that is defacing Churchill\\'s memory and suggesting that he and not Adolf Hitler is the true villain of World War II. I would love Douglas and and this is I think a way to start to talk about your um incredible interview uh with Joe Rogan and Dave Smith. But before we get there, I would love just your riff on the so-called woke right. How worried should we be about the illiberalism that\\'s taking root not necessarily in Washington yet, but certainly in major precincts of the online space? If culture, if politics is downstream of culture, how worried should we be about a movement that\\'s increasingly popular that is revisionist in its view of our history and of our heroes? Well, it\\'s a little early to say. I mean, it I can see absolutely how they could get more influence and it could be more dangerous and more unpleasant. Um, at the same time, I can see how one could overstate it. You know, I mean, um, uh, the president doesn\\'t share the views of some of the people who are rampaging around online, uh, about history or or the present. Um, so I it\\'s it\\'s a difficult time to predict it. If if it isn\\'t headed off and countered and argued against, then I can certainly say I see how it would grow. What I think is happening, by the way, maybe this is a useful way into it, is what I think is happening is that um when people are part of a movement that is reactionary, they have a problem at the moment of victory, which is what do you do now? You\\'ve won. I mean, your guy is in office. I think that people give away a lot about what they really mean to do when when they do what they do at the point of victory. What did you want your victory for? Was it to was it to own the libs or as you said in the recent piece, you know, cry harder libs isn\\'t a policy. Uh that was something you could treat yourself to maybe in the uh Biden years, but not not now. This is too serious. What some people do do when they have a rather unformed philosophy, which is is me being probably very snooty, of course, in saying that, but I think you can\\'t help your accent, Douglas. But I just think that if somebody has a rather unformed philosophy, one of the things you do, and I mean people do this when they\\'re very young, I think we probably all did this, is that you you look around for the stuff that was left behind to see if some of it was stuff you shouldn\\'t have left behind. Mhm. Uh the left has done that for years and parts of it have continued to celebrate, you know, shavar. Some of them, you know, you see young leftists looking to see if they can do Mauoism again or whatever. And the cleverer ones realize, no, you know, 70 million people died and that\\'s bad and, you know, so let\\'s not try that again. And um and some of the less intelligent ones will fall into it. And some of the ones who actually are malevolent and want to want to do bad things will will do this exercise. I think the part of the right that\\'s been victorious is is weirdly treating itself to a version of this game. Not only have we won, but maybe we can look back and see why we lost for so long. And on the right, that version is uh I suppose you get it in little bits of the Catholic right still online and off of sort of Francoism uh admiration. You you can sort of you can sort of play it that way and they do. Um but others are clearly trying again and this is very an interesting explanation for this because they\\'re basically trying a Buchananite Paulite right interpretation of the last century which Buchanan being Pat Buchanan basan and and there\\'s a reason for that which is is that for all sorts of reasons we can get both go into and know very well um post Iraq post Afghanistan uh essentially The Republican party lost an entire generation or two of foreign policy experts because they had been shown to be wrong or wrong in part or significantly wrong or wildly wrong, evily wrong, however you want to portray it. But by the time of the Trump era in 2015 16, nobody wanted to hear again from the old guard. Now that what that means is you have this huge gap in young people coming up because they don\\'t want to hear from Dick Cheney. I mean, you know, to put it at it most, they really they really don\\'t want Dick Cheney to come out and tell them where they might be going wrong. And uh they wouldn\\'t have wanted to have heard from Donald Rumsfeld when he was still alive or from, you know, any number of other people we could name. But that means that there\\'s this vast land that needs to be grabbed that people are wanting to grab. And one of the things they seem to be wanting to grab is, you see, go back earlier than that. Go back before that. Why did we get involved in World War II? We America. We got involved in World War II and we shouldn\\'t have done it with blood and treasure. And maybe we could have just allowed the Nazis and the Soviets to fight it out. The fascists and the communists could have fought it out. That\\'s a sort of interesting um that\\'s an interesting essay to ask a 17-year-old history student to do, but it\\'s not serious politics. And it\\'s certainly not a basis for a policy. Go back a bit earlier and you get the people who are now the reason why you\\'ve got this weird online right-wing anti-urchialism. I wrote about left-wing anti-urchism because the left always wants to attack Churchill because they want to destroy the heroes. They want to take out and dassinate the public square, you know, take out Jefferson, take out Lincoln, take out the right has its own right. Now the right has an iteration of this and the rights iteration of it. Now I say all the right we\\'re talking about like inflection point people really uh their aim is to say that it was Churchill who got America into the war and Churchill who indeed got the world into the war. And this is of course a historical nonsense, but it\\'s a very dangerous thing to play around with. And the way I see it is it\\'s a and I\\'ve learned a bit more about this in uh recent months, but um because I I sort of didn\\'t take it that seriously for a bit, but I think what they\\'re trying to do is is effectively a form of David Irvingism, which is David Irving, who was a once renowned uh historian of World War II in Hitler\\'s Germany, um who became more and more kooky as the years went on, or at least perhaps he revealed himself as the years went on. and he and others used to play this very dark game in the late 20th century before it was effectively stopped in a courtroom when he was shown to be a Hitler apologist. um was that they wanted to downplay the numbers of Jews killed in the Holocaust, up the number of people killed in for instance the bombing of Dresdon, find moral parity between the two, literally numbers par and then make the final move which was actually the Nazis were better than the allies. I think it\\'s a version of that that is starting to go around at the moment. at at the same time one cannot overestimate it because it this isn\\'t this isn\\'t something the president believes when involved in Marco Rubio doesn\\'t and and so at the same time I think we should not underestimate it because it has a potential among other things to completely pollute the side that it\\'s on well you take it seriously enough that in your recent appearance on Joe Rogan alongside a comedian and libertarian Dave Smith. I\\'m certain that anyone watching this by now has seen that interview, but for those who haven\\'t, go look it up after the show. Um, you feel strongly enough about this that straight out the gate in this interview where you were ostensibly there to promote your new book, you went right for it and criticized Rogan and Dave Smith for having on having kind of uncritical conversations, let\\'s say even praiseworthy conversations with amateur historians and others who are playing around in the way that you describe David Irving playing around. Yes. Why were you willing to die on this hill? And let me explain what I mean by that. Joe Rogan has a bigger audience than probably all of CNN in a month. I mean, it\\'s there\\'s just no comparison. He is the King Kong of the podcasting space. There\\'s a reason that everyone wants to go on that show, especially people promoting their books or promoting their work. And there\\'s every incentive to keep him happy. So, you will continue to get invited on. you got invited on that show and you go right for it in challenging him and challenging Dave Smith. Why did you decide to do that? Well, I couldn\\'t not. I mean, I just have a basic policy in my life which is that if I uh you know and I I I sometimes give this advice to students when I speak at universities. It\\'s like you just don\\'t do things that make you feel worse about yourself. You know, if if there\\'s something that\\'s going to demoralize you that you\\'re going to feel terrible about afterwards, feel lesser about yourself, just just try not to do it. Uh I literally have it in this sort of could I look myself in the mirror tomorrow if I did didn\\'t do this. And the answer is no. And so I do it. I don\\'t know if it\\'s a hill to die on. I the number of hills that I\\'ve been on in my life and the number of dying I\\'ve done. And uh so I don\\'t know. I just I I genuinely I was it was not I don\\'t have anything against Joe. I was um surprised that after a year and a half in Israel, two years of Ukraine or three years, there had been so few people on who had in any ways mainstream views really about either conflict. Uh, I was surprised he hadn\\'t had anyone on who really or almost no one on who\\'d explained the Ukrainian case for self-defense against Putin. And I\\'m more alarmed in the last year and a half even to find that he had had so few people on who\\'d explained the justification for Israel\\'s war in Gaza. whilst going to people who who I\\'m afraid to tread back into the uh uh the ces pool I managed to find myself in uh in the weeks after that interview is I\\'m afraid is people who don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about and I feel there\\'s a very um there\\'s a there\\'s a lot that I feel like I trod into on that but nevertheless I I just felt I had to uh I don\\'t I don\\'t like that I don\\'t like the platforming of endless weird kooky voices from self I mean semi-selftaught people I I so here\\'s the problem as I see it but is the problem with being self-taught or is no it\\'s not I mean as I stressed repeatedly in the interview anyone can say anything they want within the confines of the law Anyone can have a view on anything. I\\'m for that. I spent much of my career advocating for that. But that it doesn\\'t mean just because some experts have let themselves down or let all of us down. It doesn\\'t mean that you should simply lift the slooes of your society and allow all the sewage to just flow through it. And that\\'s what I see happening. And you see the problem here is Joe is a very skilled podcaster. People don\\'t realize how good he is until you see somebody who can\\'t do what he does. But if he if he wants somebody to discuss MMA fighting, you will notice that he does not invite comedian Dave Smith because comedian Dave Smith has never been in a fight or to a fight or maybe he has, but I don\\'t think he\\'d know how to talk about the jiu-jitsu. Maybe he would. Maybe he surprised me. I Joe would not have him on to talk about something that Joe knows about. So why does he have him on to talk about a conflict that the guy knows so little about? Um, somebody recently upped on X, uh, a snippet of an interview that Joe did a while ago with one of these pseudo historians where he says, you know, nobody has a right to say that you\\'re a neo-Nazi or Hitler apologist unless they\\'ve uh, embied your work and listened to all of it. And, you know, it\\'s like talking to somebody who thinks they know about a country who\\'s never been there. And I think, yeah, yeah, that was one of the points I was trying to make. I mean, I was pretty alarmed by some of I don\\'t really follow uh fires I\\'ve started in general, but I was pretty alarmed by uh the reaction. I was pretty alarmed by the number of people who found it, including Joe and Dave, found it to be some kind of really weird uh snooty elitist thing to say if you\\'re going to write about a place, you should have been there or know about it. You should you should you should do some of the leg work. I was pretty alarmed about that simply because in old media, I\\'ve certainly that was a standout. Good God, the old media, legacy media, let us all down in ways that you and I could riff about for a fortnight. But there there are standards. One of them, for instance, is that, you know, you cannot file uh columns about uh uh Gaza if you\\'ve never left Berkeley or San Diego or wherever. And and just to play it another way round, I mean, if what I was saying was just such basic journalistic hygiene, which is yes, if you\\'re going to talk endlessly about a conflict, you ought to do what I do and at least put in the leg work. And it\\'s kind of in a way it\\'s insulting to all the many journalists who put themselves under dangerous and difficult positions to say, \"H, that\\'s just nah, you don\\'t you don\\'t need to do that. There\\'s no, you know, I I can tell as much by sitting in Austin uh reading uh uh Google. And just to put it another way round, if uh if there was a guy in China who was on Chinese state media, what other type is there? um and endlessly wrote about the United States of America, didn\\'t speak English and had never been to the USA, but who endlessly told the audiences in China that America in the 21st century is no different from America in the 19th century. In fact, the KKK roams the streets of New York freely and persecutes our black brothers and sisters and and and that and the segregation is still going on I and all sorts of other stuff like that. If we got wind of this guy and we found out this is a this is a this is a guy in China who\\'s never been to America and he\\'s telling the Chinese people about America and it\\'s so wrong. We would laugh at that. We would think it ridiculous that such a person had platforms. So why why I ask should it be the case that endlessly if you want to hear about the reality of Israel and Gaza, get the comedian guy on who\\'s never been to the region, as he admitted on that podcast. In fact, not being to the region seemed to be some kind of badge of honor. Uh it meant that he wasn\\'t tainted by uh some of the um perspectives he might have got. Think yeah. On the other hand, you\\'d have noticed that Israel isn\\'t a white supremacist society governing a concentration camp in Gaza. I think one of the dynamics at play here, and this goes beyond the conversation that you had with Smith on Rogan, I think it\\'s just a a bigger dynamic playing out right now, is over the past decade, probably longer, the left was in the business of making everything taboo. Even biological reality became taboo. Exactly. backlash and the reaction the cultural right is having the right like broadly defined here and I think it\\'s breaking apart in all kinds of interesting ways is no no you guys said everything taboo we\\'re making nothing taboo and so the second someone comes around as you tried to do in that conversation and say actually you know what the stigmatization of Holocaust denial that\\'s a good stigma that\\'s something we should keep around the standard of going to a place that you write about that\\'s something we should keep around what the listener, I think, can hear in that situation is this is a person calling for cancel culture. This is a person calling for gatekeeping. And I find that dynamic extremely frustrating. It\\'s very frustrating. How do you get out of that trap? One, I I just you got to exercise hygiene on your own side. Um and the fact that people have been kept out of the conversation who should have been in the conversation does not mean that absolutely everybody should be given the platform to spread untrue things and it\\'s very it\\'s it\\'s going to be yeah I mean like like everything difficult in this life it\\'s uh it\\'s it\\'s going to take some dexterity because all these fine corners that end up mattering they do need careful thinking and careful treading. My my fear on it is that I think that something among other things something quite dishonest has been going on which is that Joe and Dave were covering for a couple of people in particular who are mates of theirs who they deny are bad actors and yet the more I look into them the more appalling the bad actorness is. Just this morning, somebody sent some something to me of one of the mates of one of these historians who\\'s anti-Church and so on. And this is one of his mates and somebody he cites. And this I won\\'t give the publicity to the person by naming him. This guy in this video I watched this morning goes to the Holocaust Memorial in DC and just does a video about what horseshit it all is. The Holocaust. Yeah. And it\\'s all just it\\'s all seems to me to be kind of, you know, lame and gay and fake and uh we\\'re all being told to believe this just to guilt us and, you know, not falling for it anymore. You you don\\'t want to be within you don\\'t want to be in the orbit of somebody like that. You don\\'t want to be encouraging that. You know, you can you can easily easily as a right and somebody who\\'s been a small C conservative all my life. I mean, I had a probably a lapse at the university of a period where for about 5 hours I was on the left, but um but I\\' I\\'ve been broadly on the right most of my life. And just as the left should be totally not tolerating sheavaraism, mauism, Stalinism, Leninism, don\\'t don\\'t let the right when they\\'re on the up when they\\'re working, when they\\'re actually doing some of the things that restrain some of the obscenities and overreaches of the left, don\\'t use that time to try Hitlerism again. For God\\'s sake, don\\'t be the thing that your enemies said you might be. this shouldn\\'t be that difficult. And I intervened uh on that episode and Rogan because I just felt I had to. And uh I\\'m glad I did. But I\\'m sorry that some people have willfully or otherwise decided to completely misrepresent what I was saying. But as you know Barry, one of the things about being in the public square is that not only do you have to forge your words for people to understand them clearly, you also have to forge them in such a way that a malevolent actor will not deliberately misrepresent. Possible. Okay. I want to talk about your book and I think the way maybe to set the scene here is we\\'re living in a moment Douglas where we have a cultural right. let\\'s not say the right but a increasing group with increasing power on the cultural right that is you know revising whether or not Churchill was a good or a bad guy revising whether or not the Holocaust was as evil and as bad as we remember while at the same time we have a very powerful movement and a chic movement um on the left that is calling to globalize the inifat that you know just at Yale a few nights ago students in Hamas headbands were chanting, you know, father, son, mother, daughter, we will honor all our martyrs, uh, while harassing Jewish students. This was at Yale, uh, not yet one of Trump\\'s targets. Before we get to the book, I want you to just diagnose for me where we are. You know, there\\'s a understanding that anti-semitism, rising anti-semitism, the mainstreaming of anti-semitism is a sign that a society is in very dire straits. Is that what you see here in America or in the West? And if not, what is the reason that these ideological movements seem to be gaining such power at the moment? It\\'s again, it\\'s slightly like where we start off. I\\'m I\\'m wary of it because I\\'m wary of overdiagnosing and of underdiagnosing. I never like the uh you know, I\\'ve spent the last year and a half covering the actual war in the Middle East. Uh as you know, I mean, the book is really about three things. One is what happened on October the 7th and the testimonies I get from survivors and families and others. The second is that I wanted to see and chronicle Israel\\'s military response and societal response up close. And the third thing really in the book is to ask why why in this fight between what I call a democracy and a death cult between the nation of Israel and the death cults of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iranian revolutionary government who literally worship death, love death, seek death for others and for themselves. Why would so many people find it so hard to know which side to be on? And I I spent a lot of time thinking about that because it\\'s haunted me ever since I saw the first bits of footage coming out of Israel of the Hamas terrorists killing people with such ecstasy, high orastically violent. And you know it would be equivalent to if in the \\' 40s the Nazis had broadcast from Bergen Bellson to the world boasting and then anyone in the world saying no didn\\'t happen or well it may have happened but there\\'s some reasons and and so on. These guys broadcast to the world what they were doing. So why did so much of the elite world and some other bits as well, you know, but why did so much of the elite world go onto the side of the death cult? I\\'m concerned about not getting this question wrong because on the one hand talking about Ivy League campuses is so damn rarified. What do these places mean really? They mean that our elite institutions have gone rotten. You and I could have told anyone that at any time in our adult lifetimes. But so I don\\'t want to exaggerate it because because a lot of just ordinary Americans on the streets don\\'t want this. No, but there\\'s a recent there\\'s a recent amount to say. Yes, you are. Yes. But there\\'s a recent poll of young Americans and an astonishingly high number identify with Hamas. This is not a survey of Harvard undergrads. It\\'s young Americans getting their information from Tik Tok and Hassan on\\'s Twitch and and who knows what else. So, I do think that that is real and the kind of inoculation perhaps that was granted to a generation above us um that you know I guess the showa inadvertently provided that inoculation is gone. It\\'s gone. I think I think it\\'s not just that that has gone. I think that there there\\'s something very important psychologically which I if I can say so which I identify in the book which is in the book before this the war on the west I talked at some length about the anti-Americanism and anti-westernism that existed in America in particular um and what I said there was that there was a very dangerous thing being set up in the United States and in other western countries which was that young people born in the 21st century were being told that They were guilty of things that they could not possibly conceivably be said to have guilt for. You know, you are guilty if you are born in America in the 21st century of slavery, uh, genocide, ethnic cleansing, white supremacy, and so on. These these are all charges you can take on their own, and they have more and less legitimacy wherever you want to look in the American past, as in any country\\'s past. But to say to people you are guilty with no form of alleviation of the guilt was as I said in the war on the west an extremely dangerous trap to put people into. I lent uh on Hana Ari\\'s philosophy in this about the not setting up a a a system of guilt with no possibility of forgiveness. And I said in the war in the west I didn\\'t know exactly how it was going to manifest. I could see it manifesting in the western anti-westernism and the American anti-Americanism. The one thing you can be sure of, as Alan Bloom said, uh, in the 1980s, one thing you could be sure of was not just that that a student at an American elite university would think that all truth was relative, but by the 2020s that all of the problems of the world were our fault. Now, as I see it, much of the reaction of the uh the student uh groups and so on, first of all, it\\'s all imported in one way or another. Well, the ideas are Soviet. There\\'s that. There\\'s also the fact that honor our martyrs. Come on. This is imported crab. This is Qatari funded, Qatari influenced, Iranian influenced import ideology. This is not a generic ideology that happened to crop up at But but I want to push back on that because I do think that\\'s a little bit of a cope. Like I we have a huge story in the free press today about the 29 billion dollars from foreign governments including Qatar and China that have flowed into elite universities. And if you\\'re looking to invest and pour fuel on a fire of anti-Americanism, you can do no better than the Ivy League. But let\\'s not delude ourselves into thinking that I\\'m by no means pretending that that\\'s the only cause. I\\'m saying that once something is pushed like this, once a kerosene like this is pushed by a foreign power into a highly receptive environment, something happens. And I\\'ll just quickly explain what it is that\\'s happened. What has happened in the last 18 months and not just on the campuses at uh Grand Union Station here in New York the other night where protesters pro- Hamas protesters shut the station down again. uh what they\\'re doing is what a psychologist would call projection. They are accusing the state of Israel of all of the things that they have been taught that they themselves are guilty of. They have been told that by dent of being in America in the 21st century, you are on stolen land. What do you do about it? Do any of the kids or their professors in question want to hand over the ground of UCLA to a tribe that has died out? Or and they don\\'t. They could. They don\\'t. But what can you do? I wonder. It turns out that you can accuse the one Jewish state in the world of all of the crimes that you have been told you are guilty of by dent of being born in the West. Why does this stuff work so well in specific countries? Works so well in America, so well in Australia, so well in Canada, so well in Britain, in the Anglosphere effectively because all of these countries have been prepared for this in recent years. They have all been prepared knowingly or otherwise for just such a moment of scapegoatism. Just such a moment where you can say all of my sins, all of the things that I\\'ve been like the uh Scientologists, you know, with the particles they believe that you get get from some This is how they go. This is how you go clear. This is how you go clear. This is how you you you you you decide your student days will be best spent hollering hollering against the state of Israel because you can accuse them of all the things you\\'ve been told you\\'re guilty of. This is projection on a massive scale. But but the evil the evil that it reveals is extraordinary. I give an example in the book of we have many examples but one of the ones that really shattered me was when the NOVA party uh which as people will know was one of the the targets that Hermes came upon that morning October the 7th 2023 when the NOVA party was memorialized it was um there was an exhibition you probably saw I saw it in Tel Aviv when it started But it it it was a memorial exhibition and a sort of recreation of you know what happened testimony and it and the exhibition traveled to Los Angeles and also here to New York not far from where we\\'re sitting at the moment. And when this exhibition opened, it was greeted by hundreds of protesters who, some of whom on the way, you\\'ll remember, covered their faces in kafir and co masks because, as I can never resist saying, these people are simultaneously hot for inifard and fearful of the co 19 virus, wildly worried about the uh the delta variant. I\\'m sure we can agree. But these cowards, the new KKK, they cover their faces just like this. They\\'re cowards. These people are on the New York subway chanting that asking for any Zionists to identify themselves and get off the train. They get to uh the center of New York and they go to the Nova exhibition and they stand outside and they chant support for Hamas, support for inifada, support for the murder of people at the Nova Party claim that the Nova Party itself was guilty and a legitimate target. One of the men walking through the street of New York that day to the exhibition was a father who lost his daughters at the party. He had to walk in New York past a crowd of hundreds of people with a stage and megaphones celebrating the murder of his children. What level of evil do you have to have fallen into that you would think that you would stand outside a memorial to the young people killed at that party and say that the young people dancing in the early hours were guilty and deserved the slaughter and the rape and the murder and the beheading and the kidnapping. This is not a problem for Israel. And I\\'ve said this since October the 8th. This is not a problem for Israel. Israel has an army and it has a civilian army and it has the right to make its own decisions about how it protects itself. But this is a profound problem for America and the rest of the West that we have people in our midst who glorify in the death cults who find it easy to decide. Some people find it difficult to decide whether they\\'re on the side of Israel on or Hamas. I don\\'t. I know which side I\\'m on. I know which side I want to thrive and to win. And I know which side I want to to be over in order that the Israelis can live in peace and the Palestinians can live in peace. Hamas is a disaster for Israel, but it\\'s an even bigger disaster for the Palestinians. But that aside, why do so many people find it so easy to be on the side of the death cult of Hamas? Why do so many of them not sure which side I\\'m on here? Same people who said for years believe all women. They don\\'t believe Israeli women when they\\'re raped. They simultaneously deny that women were raped on the 7th of October and claim that the IDF when they go into Gaza can\\'t help but rape women. Once again, projection. You claim that Israel is doing things your own side is doing. What? They accuse the Israelis of being baby killers. I see everything you\\'ve I I They support the baby killers. They literally love the baby killers. But how is it simply that people that that evil is real and that evil of course evil is real, but but explain give us your best explanation of the unexplainable. How can it be that so many people who have been educated at the most storied institutions in American life are falling prey to this? And maybe put another way, and you write about this in the book, and as I read it, I\\'m like, \"Wow, I can\\'t I can\\'t believe I didn\\'t think about it this way.\" You know, there\\'s been so many protests since October 7th, 2023. And what you write about and point out is that there was no mass protest in this country against Hamas. No, no. I\\'m I\\'m an optimist. I I believe that the vast majority of ordinary Americans understand which side is overwhelmingly on the side of good and which is on the side of evil in this conflict. But explain that to us. How have the most vocal, passionate people been on the side of evil? And where are the voices in this country and perhaps in the West more broadly on the side of the good? Well, there are a lot of people on the side of the good. a lot of good people with a voice and some without, many without. Um, uh, I I have no instinctive sort of optimism or sort of panglosianism nor pessimism or depression about any of this. I simply look at the situation as it is. I would just say that there are a couple of historical examples I give in the book which I\\'m really really keen that people absorb which are relatively little known but the aim of them from previous outbursts of anti-Israelism anti-semitism anti-Jewishness and so on. One of the things I\\'m very keen to point out in a couple of the stories and anecdotes I tell historical comparisons I make is to enliven people to the to recognize the idea that sometimes you can become precisely the thing you meant not to become. Sometimes in the name everybody know used to know this sometimes in order to do the worst evil you have to think you\\'re doing the greatest good. Sometimes you\\'ll find yourself thinking, for instance, I\\'m an anti-Nazi. I\\'m an anti-Nazi. I\\'m sure I\\'m an anti-Nazi. I\\'ve always been anti-Nazi. I don\\'t like the people. And then you\\'re on the side of Hamez because of reasons I give in the book. The truth is, as I say at one point in the book, that our age is very loathed to use the theological language of evil. But it\\'s become my certain belief in the last couple of years that we have to be able to use this term because some things deserve it. And the actions of Hamas absolutely deserve it. not just their treatment of the Israelis on October the 7th and since and their treatment of the kidnappies, but the treatment of people in their own society they claim to govern. Um, if evil exists as a force in the world, as I believe it does, then it must be countered judiciously, carefully, always, always, as I believe I\\'ve seen with the IDF, always in the knowledge that what you are doing must be in defense of a society and not motivated by a hatred. But it must be comprehensively destroyed. And I have little truck with the people who say that Hamas alone of all human ideologies is indestructible. Without needing to cite the Nazis, I would just say look at the cult of the emperor in Japan in up until 1945. We thought it could never be destroyed. It was far more powerful than Hamas. Far more powerful. And this country, America, which so many people on the left and now on the right want to disparage, they pretend that did no good in the world. This country, America, among its many great achievements, saw off the death cult of the Japanese emperor by military defeat and by moral victory. And if America could do that, then it can do it again. Wow. Okay. I want to take some questions from people that have been sending them in, and thank you all so much. Please continue to send them in. Um, Douglas, one of our readers asked this. Do you think that the new rights, anti-Church, anti- endless war stance has anti-semitism at its core? Well, only in the same way that everything has anti-semitism at its core. I mean, everything does. It\\'s amazing. the Jews like there is the perfect scapegoat. I\\'m completely convinced by Gerard\\'s uh analysis of a scapegoat in human society. This is Rene Gerard. Yeah. And um it\\'s violence and sacred and I\\'m completely convinced by it. It\\'s a it\\'s a just a perennial human psychological need. Um, among other things, by the way, Jews, Jews end up being the perfect scapegoat because what happens with paranoids, with what happens with paranoia? You don\\'t need to have met a Jew uh to start to get paranoid about Jews if you\\'re going down a level of paranoia because somebody somebody\\'s controlling things. I can\\'t understand the world. some somebody must understand it and there must be somebody running it otherwise it\\'s damn disorder everywhere and and like nobody\\'s in control and I can\\'t cope with that thing so I\\'ll decide there are a group of people in control and and then in the end it\\'s quite easy to see it as being bankers and then that would be the Rothschilds obviously it wouldn\\'t be bank of America and it wouldn\\'t be the bank of Scotland it can\\'t be the bank of Scotland it\\'s got to be Rothschilds got to only thing that makes sense if I see a puppet master cuz there must be a puppet master because otherwise it\\'s so darn complicated in this life And like if there\\'s a puppet master like is it better if their surname ends with Vitz or Stein or is it better if it finishes with Smith like ah the Steins and the Schmidts are sort of more available for the great and there you are then you\\'re off and so yes I mean look at the way in which the isolationists like Buchanan they always end up with with the thing that somehow you know you\\'re never America is never lured into war by uh Armitage and Powell. It\\'s it\\'s the the the got to be Wow. It\\'s got to be Waritz. It it\\'s it\\'s got to be Dick Pearl who was one member of an advisory board to the Pentagon for a time. It\\'s it\\'s it\\'s never Obama. I It\\'s never is Samantha Power. I don\\'t think so. One of the things this this unfunny comic said to me on the the the the Rogan thing was that the Wulovitz Wulovitz remember it\\'s always best to do it like that. The the Wulovitz doctrine had been trying to topple all these states and it had been done and I think the only one he was right on I think if I remember right was was Libya which happened happened under President Obama\\'s time. So, so like they\\'ll always find a Jew somewhere, not even connected to the administration of the time, who they can blame for this. And I\\'m sorry, but that is just so transparent. So transparent. Okay, someone else asks, \"I have my daughter\\'s Ivy League university graduation in 3 weeks. Congratulations. Last year they had pro- Hamas protests. How can I preempt this disruption? What should we parents shout back if they do show up? Douglas, any slogans they should shout? It\\'s so sad because I don\\'t I wish nobody had to do this. I wish nobody had to do this. These people are polluting the life of the university, polluting a graduation day. This should be a great moment of pride for the family and for the students. It should not be disrupted by these people. I would personally say to the administration that after my child has got heavily in debt for the great pleasure of being at this university, I would appreciate it very much if the ceremony was not overtaken by ideologues and maniacs of any stripe. So that\\'s what I would ask first. And if I saw them on the day, depending on how much fire I had in my belly that day, I would uh well, I\\'d have quite a lot of choice things to say to them, but I imagine many of them will be masked. Tell them to bring up bring take their masks off. If they\\'re so so damn proud if they\\'re so damn proud of their work. I don\\'t mask. You don\\'t mask. We\\'re proud of our work. We\\'re proud of what we say. We stand by what we say. Unmask you cats. Douglas, a lot of people ask a version of this question, which is, \"What can we do?\" A lot of people who read the free press and also and of course read your brilliant, brilliant Sunday column, Things Worth Remembering identify with you, admire you, trust what you are saying and the way you\\'re diagnosing the problem. And they think to themselves, and they\\'re asking in the questions, I don\\'t have a large platform, but I care so much about the kind of problems you\\'re describing, and I\\'m alarmed, Douglas, as you are. What can we do? they asked to stand up against the rise of anti-semitism and and anti-Americanism in our country. Well, the first thing is we should identify both of those things. We shouldn\\'t be afraid to. You know what I one of the things I\\'m surprised by about this dissonant bit on the right that we talked about earlier is that it is anti-American just as surely as the Chomskyite left was anti-American when it said that America could do no good in the world and never had done any good. So the isolationistish right is also being anti-American. They believe that America\\'s never done any good in the world. I think that\\'s flat out wrong. We should say it\\'s anti-American just as we should not be afraid to call out anti-semitism where it could exist and identify it as such. I\\'m sorry you\\'ve done nothing about any other rights issue anywhere in the world and suddenly the one Jewish state does something in self-defense. I\\'m sorry. Anti-semite. Of course. Of course. And that\\'s not gatekeeping or shutting down. It\\'s just a diagnosis. And if you\\'re an anti-semite, why not be proud of it? Why not say you are? Why don\\'t you admit it? Admit that you have this dark thing in your heart. What can people do? The most important thing I think is that people should not give up on the fact that in a society like this where everybody has a voice, I think everybody should use their voice. I don\\'t think it\\'s about the size of the platform. You know, it\\'s about the onetoone face-toface interaction which has always been one of the guiding things in this country. Even the much oversighted detoxville says that he\\'s surprised by the face-to-face nature of American debate. I also think back to when I knew absolutely nothing about all this when I was a student at Oxford. I haven\\'t said this before, but I remember once getting into a late night discussion with some contemporaries the second inifard was going on. I knew nothing about it, but I was horrified as everybody was by seeing the killing and the deaths on the pages. I think the Janine massacre had just been claimed to have occurred or maybe that was sometime later. And all the papers and the BBC and everything else in the UK was filled with uh anti-Israel stuff. And I suppose I was, you know, as worried as anyone else what\\'s there seems to be killing going on. And I\\'m uh intelligent enough. I\\'m uh grown up enough to know killing is bad, but I\\'m not yet intelligent enough to know that that\\'s not enough. Um, and I remember a fellow student who was younger than me, who happened to be Jewish, who was very angry with the discussion as it was going, informing us of what was actually happening and what the inifard meant and what it meant to people like him to see the buses blowing up and so on. And I wasn\\'t yet dogmatic enough, but we talked about it and he helped change my mind. And I think it\\'s worth saying that because everybody has a voice and you can use it judiciously and well and bravely. And that\\'s the case whether you\\'re a student arguing with other students or um somebody with a big platform. It it doesn\\'t really matter. The size of the platform is not the point. The point is simply whether or not you use your voice well in the time you have. And to my mind, and I\\'ve said this to you before, Barry, that I do believe that the great thing about truth is that it punctures the darkness, that a glimmer of light is recognized as truth. That we do know truth when we see it. We can see it. We have the ability to discern it just as surely as we can see a ray of light in the dark and it dispels the dark and what\\'s more makes people feel less alone in the dark once you recognize it. I think everybody has this opportunity and they should use it and it might be you know it might be hopeless at it might feel hopeless at times but never people should never doubt the fact that just like that discuss discussion I mentioned as a student as an ignorant student many years ago I I think people shouldn\\'t forget that almost nobody changes their mind like that it\\'s always a process and what you do is you just put a fact into someone\\'s head that they may not have considered and then the rest is their responsibility. You know, it\\'s such a beautiful place to end. I I do want to ask you one more question though and and that\\'s about this book and really the way that you have spent the past year and a half, almost two years since October 7th. Despite what many people on the internet, I\\'m sure, are saying, you are not Jewish yourself. Um, you\\'re not a foreign correspondent with a particular newspaper. rewrite for a lot of places including Happily Us. And yet I think you have done more to cover the war since October 7th. And I certainly know that you have done more to expose the irrational hatred of Jews and of the Jewish state and really of the West than anyone else that\\'s alive right now. Um, talk to me a little bit as as maybe a way to close about why you\\'ve prioritized this story. There\\'s a lot of important stories going on in the world. And of course, you\\'ve covered those, too. You\\'ve gone to Kiev and you\\'ve traveled all over Ukraine and I know if there\\'s some kind of dangerous hot spot, you will inevitably show up there in a flack jacket and a helmet. But this story has captured your time and your care and your thoughtfulness and your attention more than any other. And I think for a lot of people, even those who are broadly sympathetic to your worldview, for them it will still feel like something happening thousands of miles away that might feel very far away to them. And I\\'d love for you to explain in a busy world with only one person that has 24 hours in his day, why this story has so captured you, uh why you have been so tireless and passionate in exposing it and in telling it. It\\'s a lot of things. Um, one is, as I\\'ve said to you before, I I don\\'t like lies, and I hate the lies told about Israel. And, and if you\\'ve covered any conflict there, you\\'ll know that more than any other war zone, this is a war zone in which lies just go out everywhere every day. People lie about the idea. They lie about what the Israelis have suffered as well as what they do. So that gets me on an intellectual level. There\\'s obviously emotional levels which some of which are probably too deep for me to go into. One of them is you see is I do think that on one level the supporters of the death cults the people who would use their energies calling for the overthrow of all western civilization but who zoom in and by that that\\'s not an exaggeration of course that\\'s literally what the Columbia student protesters asked for the overthrow the destruction of all western civilization so I\\'m not on board with that cuz I love the civilization I\\'m from and I want it to continue. But they think that the first target they can actually take out is Israel. That\\'s their view. They think they can take out a country of 9 million people faster and more easily than you can take out a country of 340 million people or so. And they\\'re probably right in that regard. They\\'re probably right. If you try to overthrow the United States of America, hard. want to crush and completely destroy uh um the United Kingdom. Not as hard, could be done. People have tried before, but didn\\'t work. Want to crush a state that\\'s not yet 80 and um uh has only 9 million people in it in a very dangerous region surrounded by people who want to annihilate the people of the country. Well, these people see that as being achievable. Now, what what is it other than that it\\'s achievable? Ah, it was a fatal blow to all the rest of the West. The western tradition, as you know, is your viewers know is based on the legacy of the Bible and of Athens. Athens and Jerusalem. If you were to take Jerusalem out of the equation, you do absolutely cut off the tree of Western civilization, not on a branch, but at the root. The whole tree dies. I mentioned at one point in the book, as you know, the passage from Deuteronomy, choose life. And somebody said to me earlier today, but such an obvious edict. I said, \"No, no, it\\'s not obvious. It wasn\\'t obvious at the time of the prophets that people should choose life any more than it was obvious at the time of the Ten Commandments that murder was bad. People murdering each other all over the place.\" Um, but my point is is that this this target of the anti-Israel movement, the anti-western movement, they believe Israel is the first thing they can get. I believe that in one way they are clever in their target selection. They are right. The Islamists believe that if they take out Jerusalem as the holy city of the Jewish faith and indeed of the Christian faith that they can win for their own religious cause. The uh anti-semmites around the world always seem to believe that if you get rid of the Jews something magical happens in the world. Um I believe they\\'ve selected their target. Well, in one way they\\'re correct to understand the significance of Jerusalem. I agree with them on the significance of Jerusalem. It\\'s just that unlike them, I don\\'t want Jerusalem to fall. And that comes to the second tiny bit of an answer to that question, which is this. In one way, as I said, they\\'ve chosen their target well. And in another way, they\\'ve chosen it so wrong. Because yes, they\\'re right. They\\'re right. If you attack the tradition of the Bible, you attack the Jewish people, you attack the Jewish state, you take out this root of Western civilization and you contaminate everything, which is what always happens. Everyone knows anti-semitism is a problem for Jews, yes, but then every other horror comes out of the box. But here\\'s the thing. The reason they\\'ve chosen it wrong is that in my belief and having spent much of the last 18 months with the young men and women of the IDF, Israel isn\\'t going anywhere. It\\'s not going anywhere. The famous thing that Golden Mayer said to Joe Biden, we have a secret weapon. And he thought that she was going to tell him that they had the atomic bomb. What is the secret weapon? We have nowhere else to go. The great realization of Hetszel and the visionaries of the 19th century of Jabatinsky and the rest. The great realization that has been resolved is the Jewish people must defend the Jewish people with any friends they have, hopefully with many, but the Jewish people will defend the Jewish people in the Jewish homeland and they will not give it up. And they to quote the Samsa, I shall not die, I shall live. And in the face of the people who are calling for the murder and destruction of the Jewish people, my belief is they have chosen wrong because the Jewish people and their friends will continue to say, \"I shall not die, but I shall live.\" Douglas Murray, it\\'s always such a pleasure to talk to you on microphone or over drinks, uh, which hopefully we\\'ll do later. Your book, of course, is on democracies and death cults. It is a New York Times bestseller. It is a Sunday Times bestseller. I\\'m sure it\\'s a thousand other bestsellers. I saw during Easter weekend, you were even beating like the Easter Bunny book on Amazon, which was huge. the the Easter Bunny books all died of natural causes that Sunday. So, uh I didn\\'t have to do a jihad hunt against Easter Bunny books in the end. But the book next book will be called On Democracies, Deaf Cults, and Hippity Hoppity Easter Bunny. Perfect. Um for those of you who have not yet picked up this book, I cannot recommend it more highly. Douglas Murray, thank you so much. It\\'s my great pleasure.')]\n"

However, in his view, this choice is wrong, as attacking Israel would have far-reaching consequences for the entire Western world.\n",
